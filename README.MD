# WSN Visualization Component
This is the Processing3 code for displaying data generated for 3D Sphere based Wireless Sensor Simulations. The visualization can be run with the included example data. The computation component that generates these CSVs are not included in the repository simply because it is public and there is a lot of interesting graph research content in there...and I still want to get my PhD so. You know.
